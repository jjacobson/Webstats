# Webstats

## Objective
To build a webpage displaying various user statistics from the MobArenas minecraft servers existing MySQL database.

## Steps Taken
I used this project to familiarize myself with various aspects of web design. This project uses PHP to access the existing MobArenas MySQL database in order to display statistics on the various players. I made use of the https://crafatar.com/ skins API for displaying minecraft player skins along with their statistics. 

## The Result
The final product allows users to search for their characters to view detailed statistics on themselves or competing players. The webpage also displays the top users in the different statistics categories. Through this project I learned about using PHP for building web applications and accessing MySQL databases. I also learned a great deal about using SQL to retrieve data in different orders.
